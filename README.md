#### Description:
This is my final project for CS50x course!
Silk Way Fusion is a food blog with posts and recipes. I love travelling and exploring different cuisines, that's why I've decided to make a platform where I can share my experiences and discoveries.
#### Features
I've made **Flask** webapp using **Python, Django, HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.
I used **Bootstrap** library for some evements of my website like photos carousels, forms control and buttons, and implemented **Trix editor** form for editing new posts.
Also I've made**Sqlite** database to store information about users, posts, recipes and user's saved content.
